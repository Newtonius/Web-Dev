# Longest Segment
# ----------------------------------------
# Write a method, #longest_segment, that accepts two strings as arguments. The
# first is a long string of characters, and the second is a delimeter. Split the
# first string by the delimeter and return the longest segment.

def longest_segment(input, delimeter)

end

puts "---------Longest Segment----------"
puts longest_segment('this is a string','a') == "this is "
puts longest_segment('this is a string','i') == "s a str"
puts longest_segment('this is a string',' ') == "string"

# Next Prime
# ----------------------------------------
# Write a method, #next_prime, that accepts an integer, n, as an argument
# and returns the smallest prime number that is greater than n

def next_prime(n)
  prime_num = []
  smallest = 1

puts next_prime(19) == 23
