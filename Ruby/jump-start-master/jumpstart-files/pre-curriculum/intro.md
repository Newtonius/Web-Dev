# Intro to JumpStart

## Course Structure

Here's what the average day will look like:

When        | What
----------  |:---------------------:
6:30pm      | Attendance
6:30 - 7:00 | Code demo & Q/A
7:00 - 7:30 | Warm-up
7:30 - 9:30 | Independent work
9:30 +      | Homework problem

### Attendance
  We will take attendance every day; your record will be considered when making admission decisions. You **must** be present for attendance on assessment days.

### Code Demo
  During the coding demo, we will demonstrate solving a challenging coding problem that was assigned as homework the night before. Here, we will focus more on problem-solving architectures and design techniques.

### Warm-up
  You will have a different warm-up partner every day. Pairs will be assigned via email at the beginning of the day. After meeting your pair, the two of you will solve two sets of problems and answer the discussion questions together.

### Independent Work
  The majority of your time in JumpStart will be spent doing independent work. The independence will allow you to go through the curriculum at your own pace, but will also require some intrinsic motivation.

  You will be grouped into pods with other students at similar levels, and each pod will have a TA mentor. You are **strongly encouraged** to discuss problems with your fellow pod members and to ask your TA mentor for help.

### Homework
  You will have one homework problem every night. If your time is limited during JumpStart, feel free do the homework problem during independent work time. Don't spend more than 20 - 30 minutes on it (unless you want to!). We'll do the problem together in class (the next day) during the code demo.

## Assessments

You will have an assessment on both Thursdays during JumpStart. If you receive a passing score on either, your application will be forwarded to our admissions team for a final review. You do not need to attend week 2 if you pass assessment 1.

## How to approach JumpStart

Everyone who clears our bar gets in. This means you should be helping your fellow JumpStarters. **You are not competing with each other.**  There is no limit to the number of accepted students.

You're all at different levels and will work at different paces. **Don't worry if someone moves faster than you** or solves problems faster than you. What's important is that you get the most out of this investment of your time.

Remember that passing this assessment can speed up your application process, but failing it **will not hurt your chances of getting into a/A.** Jumpstart is a small, small piece of your journey to becoming a developer. It's outcome pails in comparison to your intrinsic motivation.
