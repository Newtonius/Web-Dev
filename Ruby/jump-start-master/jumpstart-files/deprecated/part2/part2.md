# Lesson Plan

## Intro to programming (continued)

### Review

Key Concepts:

* Code style
* Indent appropriately
* Snake case
* Spacesâ€”let your code breathe!
* Know the conventions for your programming language
* Keep your code DRY
* Single responsibility principle
* [In-line `if` and `unless`](./inline-if-and-unless.md)

Readings link with Examples (in case you get stuck or need help):
  * [Principles of Good Programming](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=331531)

#### `Exercises`

* The below is valid and correct Ruby. However, the style sucks. Take five minutes and see how many style problems you can fix (including variable naming).

```ruby
def  hello_world
puts "Hello, world!" end
```

```ruby
  def is_prime num
  n = 2
  while n < num
      if (num%n==0)
        return (false)
      end
      n = n + 1
    end
    return true
  end
```

### Reading a stack trace

Key Concepts:

Too many `end`s:
```
unexpected keyword_end, expecting end-of-input
```

Typo or out of scope variable:
```
NameError: undefined local variable or method `n' for main:Object
```

You got a `nil` where you didn't expect one:
```
NoMethodError: undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass
```

Incorrect method name (or method doesn't exist):
```
NoMethodError: undefined method `reverse' for 45:Fixnum
```

Always follow the line numbers! Stack traces don't lie.
```
NoMethodError: undefined method `capitalize' for nil:NilClass
	from /home/appacademy/projects/tmp/test.rb:18:in `greet_user'
	from /home/appacademy/projects/tmp/test.rb:14:in `third'
	from /home/appacademy/projects/tmp/test.rb:10:in `second'
	from /home/appacademy/projects/tmp/test.rb:4:in `first'
	from (irb):41
	from :0
```

---

#### `Exercises`

* For each error above, write code that raises that error.  Yes, we want you to write bad code for once :).
  * If you're having trouble, google the error and look for a stackoverflow question.  Type out the relevant parts of the code.

### Advanced arrays

* Initializing arrays: `Array.new(20, 0)` creates an array of twenty `0`s. => `Array.new(size, default_value)`
* You don't just have to index one element, you can index a range of elements!
* `arr[0..10]` (two dots) gives you all of the elements from `0` to and including `10` (the 11th element)
* `arr[0...10]` (three dots) gives you up to BUT NOT INCLUDING `arr[10]`.
* You can index from any start and end index within the range.
* You can even use negative indices! `arr[4..-1]`

---

#### `Exercises`
  * Initialize an array of 100 elements with a default value of `"yes"`, and then set every other value to `"no"`.
  * Now take that array and `puts` the subarray of only the first 10 elements (don't over-index!)
  * Then `puts` the last 10 elements.



### Function decomposition
* Break down your functions into as small pieces as possible!
* Single responsibility per function
* This will lower your cognitive load

Readings link with Examples (in case you get stuck or need help):
* [Function Decomposition Reading](function-decomposition.md)

---

#### `Exercises`
  * Take the function below and refactor it using all the tools you know (it may look familiar).  Make sure it's readable and make sure that the output is the same.  One-line what can be one-lined.  Decompose what can be decomposed.

```ruby
def pr(x)
  c = 0
  n = 2
  while true
    i = 2
    f = true
    while i < n
      if n % i == 0
        f = false
        break
      end
      i += 1
    end
    if f
      c += 1
      if c == x
        return n
      end
    end
    n += 1
  end
end

```

### Hash Maps `{}`
* A.k.a., a dictionary or a map
* Also can conceive of as an array, but with indices other than integers
* Initialized like so: `hash = {}`
* Hash rockets `{ 1 => "one" }`
* Hash keys are all unique
* `nil` values by default

* Important methods:
  * `hash[key]` and `hash[key] = value`
  * `#keys`
  * `#values`
  * `#each do |key, value|`

Readings link with Examples (in case you get stuck or need help):
* [Hash Maps Reading](./hash-maps.md)

### Custom hash defaults
* Can change the default value using `hash = Hash.new(default_value)`
* Counts pattern! `Hash.new(0)`

Readings link with Examples (in case you get stuck or need help):
* [Custom Hash Defaults Reading](./hash-defaults.md)

---

#### `Exercises`
  * Write a function called `most_common_number(array)` that takes an array, and returns the number that appears the most times. If there's a tie, just return one of the tied people.
  * Write a function called `least_frequent_word(string)` that takes in a string, and returns the word repeated most infrequently.
    * E.g., `least_frequent_word('hi ho hi hee ho hum ho hum')` should return `"hee"`
