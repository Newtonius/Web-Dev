# IRB

## Introduction

The Interactive Ruby Shell, more commonly known as IRB, is one of Ruby's most popular features, especially with new developers.
You can bash out a one-liner, try a method you've just learned about, or even build a small algorithm or two without going the whole way to writing a complete program. Itâ€™s a great way of experimenting with Ruby and checking that things work.

To get it up and running, all you need to do is type the following at a command line prompt, or in our case, into the Cloud9 terminal:

![IRB Launch](./irb-launch.png)

This launches IRB and brings you into a view like this:

![IRB View](./irb-view.png)

When you are finished with IRB, type exit to quit:

![IRB Quit](./irb-quit.png)
